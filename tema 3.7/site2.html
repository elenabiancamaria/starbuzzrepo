<h1>KEEP.IT.SIMPLE.</h1>

<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>Wait a minute, I said I wanted simple, but not borong. What is up with this design? There's<br/>
nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what I had in <br/>
mind. The type is in Helvetica, which I like, but it doesn't excite me at all. There is just no <br/>
character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need <br/>
something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.</p>
